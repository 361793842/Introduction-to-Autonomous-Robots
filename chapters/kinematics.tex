\chapter{Forward and Inverse Kinematics}\label{chap:kinematics}
In order to plan a robot's movements, we have to understand the relationship between the actuators that we can control and the robot's resulting position in the environment. For static arms, this is rather straightforward: if we know the position/angle of each joint, we can calculate the position of its end-effectors using trigonometry. This process is known as \emph{forward kinematics}. \index{Forward Kinematics} If we want to calculate the position each joint needs to be at, we need to invert this relationship. This is known as \emph{inverse kinematics}. \index{Inverse Kinematics} For mobile robots, this process is usually more involved, as speeds need to be integrated, which we refer to as \emph{odometry}\index{Odometry}.

The goals of this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\item to introduce coordinate systems and their transformations;
\item to introduce the forward kinematics of simple arms and mobile robots;
\item to understand the concept of holonomy;
\item to show how solutions for the inverse kinematics for both static and mobile robots can be derived;
\item to provide an intuition on the relationship between inverse kinematics and path-planning.
\end{itemize}
